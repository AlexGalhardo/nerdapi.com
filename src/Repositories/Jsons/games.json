		"summary": "Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection is a remastered compilation of the action-adventure shooter platform video games Drake's Fortune, Among Thieves, and Drake's Deception. Ported by Bluepoint Games, the collection was released exclusively for the PlayStation 4 on October 7, 2015 in Europe and October 9th, 2015 in North America.\n\nThe Nathan Drake Collection features the original three games in the Uncharted series with 1080p resolution, 60 frames per second, better lighting, textures and models. The collection also implements a \"Photo Mode\", a mode where the player can freeze the game at any moment to take personalized screenshots, derived from Naughty Dog's other remastered entry, The Last of Us Remastered, as well as new trophies. The ported games only include their respective single-player modes.\n\nThe pre-ordered version of The Nathan Drake Collection includes the \"Nathan Drake Pack\", which consists of single-player skins of iconic Nathan Drake outfits, as well as two weapons: the Golden AK-47 and Golden 92FS - 9mm. Pre-ordering the collection as a digital download through the PlayStation Store would also give an exclusive Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection PlayStation 4 dynamic theme.\n\nPurchasing The Nathan Drake Collection, and owning a valid subscription to PlayStation Plus, before the expiry date of December 13, 2015 would grant the player exclusive access to the multiplayer beta of A Thief's End.",

Sentenced to an eternity chained within a prison for the living damned, Kratos battles insanity at the hands of the Furies. He will be tested as he seeks freedom, redemption for his sins, and the clarity to avenge his family.",

The Materia system allows the player to customize each party member's abilities to their liking, and the Limit system grants them unique combat skills.\n\nThough minigames had been a recurring feature, FFVII introduces numerous new ones, many of them playable in the theme park Gold Saucer varying from racing with Chocobos to snowboarding.",

It is a perilous path - one that will take Ezio to Constantinople, the heart of the Ottoman Empire, where a growing army of Templars threatens to destabilize the region.\n\nIn addition to Ezio's award-winning story, the acclaimed online multiplayer experience from Assassin's Creed Brotherhood returns; refined and expanded, with more modes, more maps and more characters that allow players to test their assassin skills against others from around the world. The latest chapter in the Assassin's Creed saga also includes revolutionary gameplay, allowing players to manipulate the construct of Desmond's memories and the Animus to decipher the mysteries of his past and gain insight into the future.",

		"summary": "Similar to franchises like Devil May Cry, Rygar, and Castlevania, the game draws its inspiration from ancient Greek mythology and boasts a heavy emphasis on exploration and battle strategy. Broken into three to four acts, the game also has a strong focus on story-telling and boast tons of magic spells and abilities. Described as \"Clash of the Titans meets Heavy Metal\", God of War equips its hero with a pair of sword-like chain weapons that can grab enemies, perform multi-hit combos, and pull off a variety of different aerial attacks. Slight platforming elements and an energy collection system similar to that of Onimusha have been incorporated as well, and players are even able to use certain elements of their fallen enemies as a weapon (re: Medusa's head, for instance, can be used to turn enemies to stone after you've defeated her).",

Living poor and dying young, the lower class unite in protest as a new kind of family, gangs, who turn to a life in the underworld in their struggle to survive. A struggle, until watchful Assassins come to their side and re-ignite an age-old conflict involving London’s leaders that will echo throughout modern history, from the underground up.\n\nIntroducing Jacob Frye, who with the help of his twin sister Evie, will change the fate of millions in Assassin’s Creed Syndicate. Rise to rally and lead the underworld to break the corrupt stranglehold on London in a visceral adventure filled with action, intrigue, and brutal combat.",
