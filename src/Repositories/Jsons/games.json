        "summary": "Before man climbed down from the trees to shop in megastores and drink cappuccino, before the Earth wadded itself into a cool blue ball, before the Moon even existed, there was the Island. The Island, a massive fragment of a long-lost planet, hurtling blindly through space. Upon the surface of this paradise wanders the giant, Kabuto. Little does Kabuto know that the Island was home to others before him. In the oceans, there dwells a matriarchal race called the Sea Reapers. In their pride, they created Kabuto, as a defense against intruders. But Kabuto became conscious of himself, his loneliness, his pain - and he went berserk.\n\nSpace castaways, the Meccs piloted their ship through space, looking for their missing friends. If you haven’t guessed already, they ended up on the Island. Faced with yet another unscheduled layover while on their way to Planet Majorca, the Meccs decide to make the best of their temporary home. Just their luck - the natives are already embroiled in their own little war, and the Mecc visitors are most unwelcome!\n\nMeccaryns... Sea Reapers... Kabuto... One island isn’t big enough for the three of them.",

        "summary": "Dungeon Keeper is a strategy video game in which the player attempts to build and manage a dungeon or lair while protecting it from invading 'hero' characters intent on stealing the player's accumulated treasures and killing various monsters. This was Peter Molyneux's final project with Bullfrog before he left the company in August 1997 to form Lionhead Studios.\n\nThe player uses a mouse, represented in-game as a hand, to interact with a bar on the left-hand side of the screen, allowing them to select which rooms to build and which spells to cast. The player can also use the hand to pick up creatures and objects in the dungeon and carry them around, allowing for tactics such as gathering an assault force and dropping off the creatures en masse once a foothold has been established. The hand also allows the player to \"slap\" objects and thereby interact with them: creatures will hurry up when slapped, some traps will be triggered and prisoners in the Torture Chamber can be tortured.\n\nThe main game view is in isometric perspective; this view can be zoomed and rotated. The player also has the option of possessing one of their creatures, and seeing the dungeon from that creature's first-person perspective, as well as using their attacks and abilities. The map is divided into a grid of rectangles, most of which are invisible. A smaller part of the map is shown as a minimap in the top left corner of the screen.\n\nA world map is also available, and at the beginning of the game the player is allocated one of the 20 regions of a fictional, idyllic country to destroy. As the player progresses through these regions, each of which represents a level of the game, the areas previously conquered will appear ransacked, twisted, and evil. Before starting a new level, the Mentor will tell the player about the current region and its attributes. After completing a level, the Mentor will talk about the \"improvement\" of the destroyed region: \"The streets run with the blood of the slain. Screams of pain and howls of anguish rip the night air like a vengeful siren's song. This really is somewhere you can take the kids for the weekend.\"\n\nThe Dungeon Heart represents the Dungeon Keeper's own link to the world. If it is destroyed, the player loses the level, and must restart. Along with the heart, the player begins with a small number of imps, the generic work force for all dungeon activities: they can dig tunnels into the surrounding soil, capture enemy rooms and Portals, mine gold and gems, set traps, and even attack when desperate or threatened. Slapping creatures forces them to work faster for a while, but removes some of their health and happiness.\n\nOnce the Imps are busily working, the player must then set up a basic infrastructure: Lairs for monsters, a Hatchery (where chickens, which serve as food for the minions, are bred), and a Treasury for storing gold. After connecting the dungeon to a \"Portal\", monsters will arrive. As the game progresses, the player moves along a technology tree, unlocking further rooms.\n\nThe dungeon has a fleshed-out ecology: some creatures are natural enemies. Flies and Spiders are often found at odds with one another, while a Horned Reaper, if it has gone berserk, will attack all creatures in its path. The goals for each level are fairly straightforward: they generally fall along the lines of eliminating the heroic force or destroying all other Dungeon Keepers on the level.",

The player must defeat seven corrupt ruling heroes in order to reconquer the lands and establish his lordship over its inhabitants. The game features a corruption feature, similar to that of the Fable games, but allowing the player to \"be evil... or really evil\", where certain actions and choices affect different aspects of the story and gameplay. While the Overlord is controlled in a third person perspective, the way minions are controlled brings elements of real-time strategy and upgrades bring those of role-playing games. The game uses dark humour, and is a satirical parody of the traditional fantasy setting and plot",

The Nintendo DS stylus becomes an extension of his evil will and every precise Touch Screen command is the player-as-Overlord directing, commanding and combining minions in battle, pointing and sweeping them to attack enemies and solving puzzles to execute his dastardly plans. Controlling the Special Farces team of four, players negotiate fiendish levels and take on a huge range of warped enemies to hunt down the Kindred, a cult dedicated to resurrecting the mighty Dragon Kin, a race of humanoid dragon hybrids, determined to replace the Overlord's despotism with their own. Extending the Overlord series' trademark humour, gameplay focuses on the mischievous physical comedy of the minion's antics and is delivered in a stylised cartoon visual style.",

From your home base in europe you invade adjacent territories and, through the violent subterfuge of your agents, wrestle them from rival syndicates. Having done so, raise taxes on the locals to increase your profits and punish them for serving the wrong syndicate.\n\nBut raising taxes can make you very unpopular.and furious natives leading popular rebellions can eat into syndicate profits. So keep an eye on foreign interests and pick off troublemakers with your teams of agents. And while you're busy expanding your syndicates empire abroad, rival agents are working in your own back yard to de-stabilise your syndicate. Ensure agents are briefed to weed out traitors whose actions might bring about your downfall.\n\nBy meeting all challenges, destroying all targets and gaining control of all the territories, your syndicate triumphs.",

        "summary": "In the third instalment of the Thief series, master-thief Garrett is contacted by Keeper Artemus with a mission to steal two valuable artefacts. At the same time, Garrett learns about a prophecy: the coming of a Dark Age. He embarks upon a journey to unravel a mystery that threatens the existence of the order of Keepers. Is it possible that there is a traitor in their midst?\n\nThe stealth and thievery game, Thief: Deadly Shadows comes with a number of improvements over two previous parts. Released in 2004, it left behind the aging Dark Engine, using a heavily modified Unreal engine instead. Realistic lighting effects have been implemented: each character and object now casts its own shadow. A third person's view has been made available in addition to the standard first person perspective.\n\nThe stealth system that made Thief: The Dark Project and Thief 2: The Metal Age famous is still in place. You have to stick to the shadows and avoid making noise, as guards will react to anything suspicious. It is also the first game of the series that introduced free roaming. The City, divided into several unlockable districts, is yours to explore. You can interact with the city's inhabitants: pickpocket, steal, or even mug them for loot.",

It is the first game in the Baldur's Gate series and takes place in the Forgotten Realms, a high fantasy campaign setting, using a modified version of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD&D) 2nd edition rules. It was the first game to use the Infinity Engine for its graphics, with Interplay using the engine for other Forgotten Realms-licensed games, including the Icewind Dale series, as well as other licensed D&D campaign worlds such as Planescape: Torment. The game's story focuses on players controlling a protagonist of their own creation who finds themselves travelling across the Sword Coast alongside a party of companions, to unravel the mystery surrounding a sudden iron crisis affecting the region and attempting to discover the culprits behind it, all while uncovering dark secrets about their origins and dealing with attempts on their life.",

Create any kind of character you want and explore the open wastes of post-apocalyptic Washington D.C. Every minute is a fight for survival as you encounter Super Mutants, Ghouls, Raiders and other dangers of the Wasteland. Prepare for the future.\n\nThe third game in the Fallout series, Fallout 3 is a singleplayer action role-playing game (RPG) set in a post-apocalyptic Washington DC. Combining the horrific insanity of the Cold War era theory of mutually assured destruction gone terribly wrong, with the kitschy naivety of American 1950s nuclear propaganda, Fallout 3 will satisfy both players familiar with the popular first two games in its series as well as those coming to the franchise for the first time.",

Software Authors Pirated?\n\nThe Two Guys from Andromeda, designers of the graphically extravagant (and satirically sensational) Space Quest series, have disappeared into this oxygen! Hysterical game fanatics around the world await word on the whereabouts of these celestial celebrities!\n\nWho could be the mastermind behind this evil plot?\n\nCould it be the Pirates of Pestulon, known for their plundering, preying and unprincipled practices? Or maybe the legions of Space Quest fans who would kill to be the first to play Space Quest III (the graphic adventure game with the closest thing yet to motion picture-quality animation). Not to be forgotten are the monkey-suited minions of Sludge Vohaul (from our last episode), who would love to make banana pudding out of those responsible for putting them behind bars.\n\nWho are the dirty deed doers behind our daring duo's demise? Is it too late to save the two guys from a disgusting and downright despicable doom?\n\nHoly SpaceWaste, space adventurers, find out for yourself as Roger Wilco, intergalactic garbagemen, returns to the rescue!",

Step by step Roger will have to unveil a galaxy-wide biohazardous material dumping scheme, solve the mystery of the disappearance of a fellow Starfleet captain and his ship, and confront an agent of an old nemesis.",

You are cast as the immortal emperor who shapes the future of your race, as contact is made with the neighbouring races. Your objective is simple: control a majority of the known galaxy and eliminate all who stand in the way.\n\nAs ruler you must ultimately decide the destiny of your race as you make decisions on how planetary resources are allocated, where star fleets will be deployed, which races to fight, and which races to ally with. You begin with control of your home planet, from which you can explore and colonize nearby star systems. Your first decisions will centre around the rapid development of colonies into productive worlds, what types of technology to focus on, and which star systems to colonize.\n\nHowever, the true challenge begins when contact is made with other races, and complex strategies must be formulated to manage diplomacy, sabotage, espionage, trade, and interstellar combat.",

Divisive crew members are just the tip of the iceberg, Commander, because you'll also be tasked with issues of intergalactic diplomacy. And time's a wastin' so don't be afraid to use new prompt-based actions that let you interrupt conversations, even if they could alter the fate of your crew...and the galaxy.\n\nForge new alliances, carefully. You'll fight alongside some of your most trustworthy crew members, but you'll also get the opportunity to recruit new talent. Just choose your new partners with care because the fate of the galaxy rests on your shoulders, Commander.",

Players create their own character by customizing gender and appearance as well as choosing a race and class. Combat is in real time with the ability to pause at any moment: tactical options include an editor which allows the player to give the AI detailed instructions on how to behave in every possible situation. Although the main storyline is the same for every character created, the game features six unique prologues, two for each race. Dragon Age: Origins received critical acclaim upon release, with praise mostly directed at its story, setting, characters, music and combat system.",

Like its predecessor, players can explore and engage in combat from a third-person perspective and will also encounter various companions who play major roles in the plot and gameplay. Depending on players' decisions and dialogue, a companion will either recognize the main character Hawke as a friend or a rival. The game adopts the wheel-based dialogue system, meaning short responses that reflect different tones and attitudes the player wishes to choose for Hawke. The combat system is quite similar to the one used in the previous Dragon Age game, though it has been noticeably sped up.",

Even more monster types will engage in real-time battles using the same overhead perspective as witnessed in the original game. Each selected character can parlay the experience gained from combat into acquiring new feats and enhanced abilities over time. To help in battle, a new item creation system lets players craft magical weapons and armor using raw materials found during their travels.\n\nAs before, two heroes can join the adventure in cooperative play on the same screen, with each character differing in the types of feats and powers under his or her command. Equipment can be found or purchased from local merchants using the gold looted from felled creatures or received as payment for quests. Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II also features a number of hidden areas, secret characters, and literally hundreds of items to find and use, including potions, scrolls, and wands. In addition, the game features a new branching storyline that offers players a choice where to go next for fortune and honor.",

Dune blended adventure with economic and military strategy, and is considered by many the most immersive Dune computer game. Loosely following the story of the novel, the game casts the player as Paul Atreides, with the ultimate goal of driving the Harkonnen from Planet Dune, while managing spice extraction, military, and later, ecology through the native Fremen tribes.\n\nAs the player progresses, his troops are equipped with weapons from \"crysknives\" to atomics, tap into Paul's latent psychic powers, and get acquainted with such characters from the book as Chani and Liet-Kynes.",

        "summary": "Dune II is often considered the first mainstream modern real-time strategy game and established many conventions of the genre. Even though set in Frank Herbert's famous Dune universe, the game is only loosely connected to the plot of any of the books or the films based from them. Controlling either of the three Houses, the player must fight a number of battles against the other Houses. In the early levels, the goal is simply to earn a certain number of credits, while in the later missions, all enemies must be destroyed.\n\nThe single resource in the game is the Spice, which must be collected by harvesters. The spice is converted to credits in a refinery, which are then spent to construct additional buildings and units. There are two terrain types: buildings can only be constructed on stone, while the Spice is only found on sand. However, units moving on sand attract the large sandworms of Dune, who are virtually indestructible and can swallow even large units whole. As levels progress, new and more advanced buildings and units are made available, including structures like a radar station, a repair facility or defense turrets and, for units, various ground troops, light vehicles and tanks. Each House can construct one unique special unit, and, after building a palace improvement, can unleash a unique palace effect.",

        "summary": "Just like its predecessors Need for Speed: High Stakes is an action racing game with a wide selection of exotic sports cars and many different types of tracks. The trademark Hot Pursuit mode game mode from the first game in the series is still present, where players race opponents on tracks filled with regular traffic and police cars that chase the racers. The classic pursuit mode is extended with two additional modes: Getaway and Time Trap. In Getaway the player needs to shake off the police in a set amount of time, or playing as the police trap a speeder before time runs out. In Time Trap an entire race needs to be completed before time runs out, or as the police all speeders need to be arrested. There are minor differences between the two platforms for this game mode, regarding spike strips, road blocks, and back-up. The latter for instance is unique to the PlayStation version. The Pursuit mode is available in multiplayer as well and players can take different sides or race together.\n\nIt is the first game in the series to introduce a Career mode with a set of challenges. Beating these is rewarded with trophies for unlocks, and money to spend on new cars, repairs and upgrades. In the PlayStation version the Career mode is split up into two different sets of challenges: Tournament (required races) and Special Event (optional races). High Stakes in the title refers to races where players bet their cars. In the PC version these are a part of the Career mode when the player owns more than two cars. In the PlayStation version two players can insert their memory cards and race against each other. The winner immediately receives the opponent's car and it is deleted from the loser's memory card right away.\n\nIn addition to the new game modes it is also the first game in the series to have a detailed physics models. Damage now affects both the appearance and the performance of the car for the first time.",

The prologue begins with the player driving in a Nissan Skyline R34 in Olympic City (though the racing scenes are actually in Bayview), the setting of NFS:UG. He then receives a race challenge from a rather ominous personality who offers him a spot on his crew, but \"won't take 'no' for an answer.\" The player races off — despite Samantha's warnings — only to be ambushed by a mysterious driver in a rage that totals his Skyline. The driver, who has a unique scythe tattoo, makes a call confirming the accident, and the flashback fades out.",

        "summary": "Zak McKracken is a tabloid reporter (and not a very good one at that). After having a psychedelic dream one day, Zak realizes that something is wrong -- space aliens are dumbifying the general public through the telephone system. Zak must stop this, but he can't do it alone. After finding a strange crystal, Zak manages to get the help of the anthropologist Annie and her friends, Melissa and Leslie. The four unlikely heroes must now figure out a way to destroy the dumbifying devices and save the Earth.\n\nZak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure similar in gameplay to Lucasfilm's breakthrough title Maniac Mansion. The player chooses verb commands (Open, Pick Up, Give, etc.; there are no Look or Talk commands) to interact with the game world. The game features up to four controllable protagonists; it is possible to switch between them at any time after they have been introduced, and also exchange inventory items if the characters are in the same location. The game can be described as a \"globe-trotting\" adventure, since the heroes are required to travel to different exotic countries and even leave the Earth for a while in order to complete it. Some of the puzzles are optional or can be solved in different ways.\n\nThe FM Towns version has VGA graphics with 256 colors and higher-quality music and sound effects.",

        "summary": "Hidden and Dangerous 2, like its predecessor, focuses on the British Special Air Service during the Second World War. It follows the same concept as the original tactical first/third person shooter. The game's LS3D engine was used by the game Mafia.\nGameplay elements such as the vocal commands, plan or real-time map control, vehicle usage, equipment selection and the first person mechanic were significantly enhanced from the original. The ability to take POWs, added enhanced stealth options for the player which include the acquisition of enemy uniforms. Mission types include, espionage, sabotage, search and destroy, town liberation, prisoner rescue, retrieval of enemy officers and documents, partisan assistance and assassination. The variety of locales include Norway, Libya, a Norwegian fjord, Burma, Austria, France and Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe expansion pack Sabre Squadron adds missions in France, Libya and Sicily. Some of the missions are modeled on real SAS exploits. However most of the game takes liberty with the historical time and place of SAS operations.[6] The missions are based on sandbox style game-play where players are free to roam a map and pursue objectives usually at their leisure and choice of sequence. A real time strategy mechanic also allows players to control events for staged sequential tactical maneuvers or through real time overhead command.",

        "summary": "L.A. Noire is a neo-noir detective action-adventure video game developed by Team Bondi and published by Rockstar Games. It was initially released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms on 17 May 2011; a Microsoft Windows port was later released on 8 November 2011.\n\nL.A. Noire is set in Los Angeles in 1947 and challenges the player, controlling a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer, to solve a range of cases across five divisions. Players must investigate crime scenes for clues, follow up leads, and interrogate suspects, and the player's success at these activities will impact how much of each case's story is revealed.\n\nThe game draws heavily from both the plot and aesthetic elements of film noir—stylistic films made popular in the 1940s and 1950s that share similar visual styles and themes, including crime and moral ambiguity—along with drawing inspiration from real-life crimes for its in-game cases, based upon what was reported by the Los Angeles media in 1947.\n\nThe game uses a distinctive colour palette, but in homage to film noir it includes the option to play the game in black and white. Various plot elements reference the major themes of detective and mobster stories such as The Naked City, Chinatown, The Untouchables, The Black Dahlia, and L.A. Confidential.",

Each \"movie\" is comprised of five large maps, and can be played by one to four human players, with an emphasis on team-based strategy and objectives.\n\nNew technology dubbed \"the AI Director\" is used to generate a unique gameplay experience every time you play. The Director tailors the frequency and ferocity of the zombie attacks to your performance, putting you in the middle of a fast-paced, but not overwhelming, Hollywood horror movie.\n\nAddictive single player, co-op, and multiplayer action gameplay from the makers of Counter-Strike and Half-Life Versus Mode lets you compete four-on-four with friends, playing as a human trying to get rescued, or as a zombie boss monster that will stop at nothing to destroy them.",

In function, they are simply super powered versions of standard units that have different sounds.\n\nThere are no new standard units however, which many saw as a disappointment.\n\nThe map editor also isn't updated to include any of this expansion's new features, though third party programs exist that can add these features to the editor.",

In the sequel, Starkiller returns with over-the-top Force powers and embarks on a journey to discover his own identity and to reunite with his one true love, Juno Eclipse.\n\nIn Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II, Starkiller is once again the pawn of Darth Vader — but instead of training his protégée as a ruthless assassin, the dark lord is attempting to clone his former apprentice in an attempt to create the Ultimate Sith warrior. The chase is on — Starkiller is in pursuit of Juno and Darth Vader is hunting for Starkiller.\n\nWith all-new devastating Force powers and the ability to dual-wield lightsabers, Starkiller cuts a swath through deadly new enemies across exciting worlds from the Star Wars movies — all in his desperate search for answers to his past.",

Kashyyyk is different from the previous ten planets: rather than being 16 square kilometers of openly navigable area, it is divided into a small central area with several instanced \"dungeon\" areas. A new space zone was also added. Other content added in this expansion included the ability to add cybernetic limbs to a player character, quests for three new creature mounts and two new starships. A substantial portion of the content for this expansion was adapted from the film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith which was released to theaters at approximately the same time as the expansion release.\n\nCustomers who purchased the expansion also received a limited-edition Varactyl player mount from the digital download or a BARC speeder if they purchased the box set.",

The playable sectors include the space surrounding the ten planets of the game as well as Kessel and \"Deep Space.\" Combat is real-time and twitch-oriented like a first-person shooter and can be played with a joystick at the player's option.

        "summary": "Chaos has erupted throughout the galaxy. As a leader of an elite squad of Republic Commandos, your mission is to infiltrate, dominate, and ultimately, annihalate the enemy. Your squad will follow your orders and your lead, working together as a team-instinctively, intelligently, instantly. You are their leader. They are your weapon.\n\nStar Wars: Republic Commando is a tactical first-person shooter video game, set in the Star Wars universe. It was developed by LucasArts using the Unreal Engine, and published for the Xbox and Microsoft Windows in 2005. The game features both single-player and multiplayer game modes. In the story, set in the Star Wars Legends expanded universe, players assume the role of RC-1138 (\"Boss\"), an elite clone trooper, known as \"clone commando\", and the leader of the special ops unit Delta Squad, consisting of three fellow clone commandos with distinctive personalities and character traits: RC-1262 (\"Scorch\"), RC-1140 (\"Fixer\"), and RC-1207 (\"Sev\"). The story follows Delta Squad as they complete increasingly difficult missions throughout the Clone Wars and learn to bond as a team.\n\nRepublic Commando received generally favorable reviews at release. Many critics praised the story and combat, but criticized the short length and average multiplayer. In the years since its release, it has come to be considered one of the best Star Wars games ever made, and has gained a cult following.\n\nAn enhanced port of the game by Aspyr is set to release for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 on April 6, 2021. As reported by Jordan Ramée of GameSpot, \"Handled by Aspyr Media, Star Wars: Republic Commando Remastered brings the original 2005 Xbox and PC game to PS4 and Switch with enhanced HD graphics and modernized controls, though the multiplayer is absent. Otherwise, it's the same game. And though the flaws in its gameplay are only more noticeable now 16 years later, this remaster manages to still deliver a compelling story of four specialized commandos engaging in a variety of combat missions across the Clone Wars.\".",

Kyle Katarn, a formal Imperial Stormtrooper must join the Rebel Alliance's covert operations division, and re-take the Empire from the inside, one battle at a time.\n\nUnlike many other Doom-based games, Star Wars: Dark Forces attempted a realistic approach: the missions followed a specific storyline, sometimes cut up by scenes to progress the narrative.

The levels were designed to represent actual bases, mines, facilities, and other known places from the Star Wars universe, like Star Destroyer interiors, Jabba's ship, Coruscant, etc.",

The story opens in the vicinity of the Dreighton Nebula, where Rookie One is investigating disappearances of Rebel spacecraft near Dreighton, a region rich with mythology about vanishing spacecraft.\n\nRookie One responds to a distress call coming from a ship in the nebula. Once there, he discovers an Imperial presence. As the story progresses, it becomes clear that the Empire is somehow responsible for at least some of the more recent disappearances.",

Open up your afterlife with the Pearly Gates of Heaven or the Fiery Gates of Hell, zone for the Seven Deadly Sins and/or their respective Virtues. Then lay down some roads. Soon, the dearly departed arrive in droves. Keep them in your afterlife and you flourish.

It was originally released for the Atari 8-bit systems, such as the Atari 800 and the Atari 5200. It was also ported to other popular platforms of the day, such as the Apple II, ZX Spectrum (by Dalali Software Ltd), Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, Atari 7800, and the NES. The Atari 800 version was called Ballblaster during development - pirated versions of the game went by this name as well. The principal creator and programmer of Ballblazer was David Levine.\n\nIn 1990, LucasArts and Rainbow Arts released a remake and follow-up to this game, called Masterblazer. This game was released for the Amiga, Atari ST, and PC DOS. A similar game inspired by Ballblazer called Space Football: One on One was developed and released by Triffix for the Super NES in 1992. Years later on March 31, 1997, a remake of the original titled Ballblazer Champions was released for the Sony PlayStation.",

Much like soccer, your goal is to put the ball in the net more times than your opponent does. Each player rides around in a rotofoil, used to speed around the arena field. However, in order to win the match, you must win three, four-minute rounds. Sounds easy enough, but you have to beat eight challengers in order to be the Ballblazer champion. Ballblazer offers eight characters to choose from and four modes of gameplay, including Practice, Tournament, Single-Player Free Play, and Two-Player Free Play. Each mode offers its own variety of fun",

This globe-spanning adventure pits you against evil Nazis and the Asian underworld. It’ll take more than just a trusty whip and pistol to avoid the perils of the Emperor’s Tomb.\n\nIndy's latest adventure plays out in dramatic fashion thanks to new gameplay features such as brawling combat. This time, in addition to using his trademark whip and pistol, Indy can engage in fierce hand-to-hand combat against foes, many of whom are well-versed in martial arts. Improvised weapons such as shovels, chairs and table legs also can be used to fend off adversaries. The result is a more immersive and more Indy-like gameplay experience, set amidst spine-tingling movie-like action sequences, such as a rickshaw chase in Hong Kong and a spectacular battle atop moving gondolas in the South China Sea area.",

        "summary": "Day of the Tentacle, also known as Maniac Mansion II: Day of the Tentacle, is a 1993 graphic adventure game developed and published by LucasArts. It is the sequel to the 1987 game Maniac Mansion. The game's plot follows Bernard Bernoulli and his friends Hoagie and Laverne as they attempt to stop the evil Purple Tentacle — a sentient, disembodied tentacle — from taking over the world. The player takes control of the three and solves puzzles while using time travel to explore different periods of history.\n\nDave Grossman and Tim Schafer co-led the game's development, their first time in such a role. The pair carried over a limited amount of elements from Maniac Mansion and forwent the character selection aspect to simplify development. Inspirations included Chuck Jones cartoons and the history of the United States. Day of the Tentacle is the eighth LucasArts title to use the SCUMM engine, and the company's first title to feature voice acting.\n\nThe game was released simultaneously on floppy disk and CD-ROM to critical acclaim and commercial success. Critics focused on its cartoon-style visuals and comedic elements. Day of the Tentacle has featured regularly in lists of \"top\" games published more than two decades after its release, and aspects have been referenced in popular culture.",

The player controls a fictional \"Valkyrie\" space fighter (converted for search and rescue duty) from a first-person view, attempting to land and pick up downed Ethercorps pilots. Some of these mountains hold anti-aircraft guns, which have to be avoided or destroyed. Due to the varied terrain, the direction finder has to be used to locate the pilots, whose visual beacons are often masked by mountain ridges.\n\nAt higher levels, the enemy Jaggis begin flying kamikaze saucers. The mission area also moves into day/night boundaries. Night missions are particularly difficult, requiring diligent use of the altimeter to avoid crashing.\n\nFlying consumes fuel. The way to replenish this supply is to rescue downed pilots who bring their remaining fuel supplies on board.",

Released in August 1991, the game followed the campaign by the US 8th Air Force to cripple the German Luftwaffe during the final years of World War II. Players could fly in either American or German warplanes. The game was remarkable because many of the playable airplanes were still under development during the war. In other words, the planes were never used extensively in battle, so players could explore “what if ” possibilities with the game. Those possibilities were further expanded by four Tour of Duty expansion packs. The planes in those expansions included the P-38 Lighting, a twin-engine escort fighter and the German Do335, an interceptor aircraft that featured a conventional tractor propeller in the nose as well as a pusher propeller behind the tail of the aircraft.",

Trials of Obi-Wan includes more than 50 new quests, from rescue missions to the exploration of a crashed Republic cruiser. Many quests also revolve around the return of HK-47 from Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, whom players can kill for a quest.\n\nThe expansion also allows players to interact with the ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi to help him \"correct an imbalance in the Force\" present on Mustafar. High-level quest rewards include the ability to find a fiery red crystal found only on the volcanic planet that creates a lava-like lightsaber.",

Along for the ride are award-winning journalist Maggie Robbins and internationally renowned geologist Ludger Brink.\n\nOnce the wayward asteroid is nuked into a safe orbit, the trio conducts a routine examination of the rocky surface.\n\nWhat they uncover is anything but routine.\n\nLow, Brink and Robbins unwittingly trigger a mechanism that transforms the asteroid into a crystal-like spacecraft. The team is hurled across the galaxy to a planet so desolate, Brink is moved to name it Cocytus, after the 9th circle of Hell in Dante's Inferno. The bleak landscape was obviously once home to a highly enveloped civilization, with remnants of sophisticated architecture, advanced technology and an intricate network of underground tunnels.\n\nBut no Cocytans.\n\nWho were the original inhabitants of this once rich empire-turned-wasteland? What are those apparitions that mysteriously appear from time to time? Why have Low, Robbins and Brink been brought to this place? And how can Low keep his team from unraveling in the face of such uncertainly? To return to Earth, the must dig for answer, both on the planet's surface and deep within themselves.\n\nFrom the combined talents of LucasArts and legendary filmmaker Steven Spielberg comes an epic adventure that plunges headlong into the very core of the unknown.

Whether lobbing fireballs and researching forgotten spells as a powerful Wizard, hacking a trail through legions of orcs as a Fighter armed only with a battle axe and your courage, or taking on the role of a Rogue that can slip into the shadows at a moment's notice and take the purse from even the most perceptive of guardsmen. Choose your alignment, your allies, your companions, and how you want your character to develop... design the character you want, role-play the way you want, and carry the battle to the enemy.\n\nThe design aspects of Neverwinter Nights 2 don't stop there, however. Past the campaign included with the game itself, Neverwinter Nights 2 also gives you all the tools you need to build your own modules, campaigns, and adventures for your friends - move buildings, terrain, script encounters, write dialogues, create quests and items - everything you need to create an epic adventure of your own is included in the toolset for you and any other worldbuilder to use.",

Aided by his boss, the (possibly) insane inventor/scientist Dr. Fluke Hawkins, and a genetically engineered robotic two-legged/four-armed dog named Bones (although he prefers Max), Kurt must infiltrate each Minecrawler, and fight his way to the pilot, whom he must then kill before returning to Hawkins' in-orbit space station, the Jim Dandy.",

The game has an isometric view and is set in the 17th and 18th centuries of Europe. It features sixteen playable nations each with its own architectural styles, technologies and units.\nPlayers must avoid famine and engage in army expansion, building construction and simple resource gathering. Mission scenarios range from conflicts such as Thirty Years' War to the War of the Austrian Succession, and the game is renowned for the seemingly unlimited number of units players may control. This ability set it apart from other games of the time such as Age of Empires and Empire Earth.\nCossacks is a game which allows the user to gain strategy skills and even pick up some relative history of that period by the inclusion of a comprehensive encyclopedia. This top selling title has won two awards and was positively favoured by a majority of reviewers.",

Cruel ice, lush grassland, parched desert...

Players can choose from dozens of roller coaster types and can also build log flumes, carousels, bumper cars, haunted houses, go karts, ferris wheels, and swinging ships, among other rides. The intensity and type of rides must be balanced, as visitors' preferences vary significantly from person to person. For example, some guests prefer exciting rides and have high nausea tolerance levels, while other guests are just the opposite.",

A place where great industrial cities house castle keeps and factories, home to Dwarves, Humans, Orcs and Elves alike. A place of ancient runes and steamworks, of magic and machines, of sorcery and science.\n\nArcanum is the first game to come from the development house Troika Games, LLC, started by former Fallout team members Tim Cain, Leonard Boyarsky, and Jason Anderson. This team takes the depth of gameplay and world-building in role-playing games to entirely new levels of realism and excitement.\n\nArcanum creates a compelling new world where magic and technology coexist in an uneasy balance. As Arcanum opens, the mechanical age has only recently arrived in this ancient land where Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Orcs and other races have learned to survive in the new sprawling industrialized cities. But this radical shift from magic to technology has created a potentially explosive situation. As the townspeople and other thinkers begin mass production of light bulbs, batteries, eyeglasses and guns, the Mages grow leery. This tightly wound setting is the starting point from which the character must set out on his quest.",

        "summary": "Deer Hunter is a series of hunting simulation video games. Originally available for Windows platform published by WizardWorks Software, it was also published on Mac, and later on Game Boy Color, PlayStation 2, and mobile phones. The first game in the series was developed for only USD$125,000, yet sold over a million copies and topped the PC game charts.[1] It was an early success in the casual game market.[2]\n\nThe original game was released in November, 1997. In 2003 Southlogic Studios was commissioned by WizardWorks Software to develop Trophy Hunter 2003 and because of Trophy Hunter's success, they took over the development of the Deer Hunter franchise, with Deer Hunter 2004 and Deer Hunter 2005, distributed by Atari. Glu Mobile acquired the entire franchise in April 2012.[3] The original Deer Hunter and its sequel Deer Hunter II have also been released for Macintosh computers.\n\nGameplay usually takes place in a thick forest or meadow during different seasons of the year. Animals and objects other than deer can be seen while playing, including Bigfoot and UFOs in some incarnations, but these serve no purpose other than scenery. Some animals may be shot and killed, but the player receives no trophy and will be penalized if the animal was a protected species. In the latest versions, players can also manage a deer herd with deer growth and genetics deciding the traits of offspring",

It is developed by Pyro Studios and published by Eidos Interactive.\n\nReleased during the first months of 2006, the game makes a departure from the first four games. Although the missions are set up in a similar fashion (several different objectives, some to be achieved through stealth, others through use of force) and in most occasions the player is allowed to change between different characters, this is the first game in the series to apply a first-person perspective, like many other World War II-inspired games, in contrast to the overhead view of the earlier games. Hence, the game is far more similar to the Medal of Honor or Call of Duty games than to earlier entries of the series.",

        "summary": "Wolfenstein 3D is a first-person shooter presented with rudimentary 3D graphics and a follow-up to the top-down infiltration game Castle Wolfenstein. The game is broken up into levels, each of which is a flat plane divided into areas and rooms by a grid-based pattern of walls and doors, all of equal height. Each level is themed after Nazi bunkers and buildings. To finish a level, the player must traverse through the area to reach an elevator. Levels are grouped together into named episodes, with the final level focusing on a boss fight with a particularly difficult enemy. While traversing the levels, the player must fight Nazi guards and soldiers, dogs, and other enemies while managing supplies of ammunition and health.\n\nWhile the name was kept the same as the original release, this and future releases of the game came with the base campaign and the Nocturnal Missions expansion campaign together.",

The game, released in May 2005, was developed by Haemimont.\nThe game contains various civilizations to choose from, among them are: Rome (Imperial and Republican), Egypt, Germania, Brittania, Iberia, Gaul and Carthage. It has a more elaborate hero system over its predecessor.\nThe game focuses on tactics, troop mobility and terrain topography rather than sheer strength of numbers for winning battles. Though resources are important there is less relevance in gathering them than in other real-time battle games. Instead of sending an army of servants to mine, lumber, collect food or gather any other kind of resources these are generated at a constant rate directly proportional to the inhabitants of a population center.\n\nThere are 3 player modes to choose from:\n\nConquest: The battles involved on this game are focused on raising an empire by conquering all the known ancient world, the user can choose any of the available civilizations (see below) to do so.\n\nRome's Greatest Battles: A good amount of effort has been dedicated to historical accuracy; not only on the graphics but on the story line of this pre-built scenarios on which the player can live Rome's defining moments, from The Battle of Zama which marked the final and decisive end of the Second Punic War to the rebellion of Marcus Antonius and Cleopatra.\n\nCustom Game: These feature is always present in modern day real time tactic and strategy games, it can be used to practice against computer opponents on custom made scenarios or to go on-line and battle against other human players",

        "summary": "Age of Empires: The Rise of Rome is an expansion pack for the real-time strategy game Age of Empires. It is based on the rise of the Roman Empire, and adds the Roman Empire and three other playable civilizations to Age of Empires.\n\nGameplay-wise, the expansion introduced numerous interface tweaks, such as unit queuing, the ability to double click a single unit and highlight others of the same unit-type, balancing damage done by catapults, and the option to increase the population limit beyond 50 (only in multiplayer games). By installing the 1.0a update from 1999, it is also possible to use the period key to cycle through idle villagers. The Rise of Rome also features a new Roman architectural design, shared by all four new civilizations, the Romans, Palmyrans, Macedonians and Carthaginians. Four new researchable technologies have been added. Additional new features include five new units, four new random map types, and a larger map size option. Pathfinding for all units is also considerably improved. New music was composed for this expansion, which replaced the original score entirely. After the last official patch by the developer, the game's community continued the support by an own-made unofficial patch to address remaining issues and to improve compatibility with modern hardware and OSes.",

Each epoch brings new technologies and units. Epoch advancement requires additional buildings to be built and the costs of advancing increases as more epochs are attained, although the ability to gather the required resources greatly increases as well. With new epochs, some new units are available at the cost of having to abandon the ability to produce old units, though any old units still alive are kept. The epochs in Empire Earth are the Prehistoric Age, the Stone Age, the Copper Age, the Bronze age, the Dark Age, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Imperial age, the Industrial age, the Atomic World War I age, the Atomic World War II Age, the Atomic Modern Age, the Digital Age and the Nano Age.

You have aboard your ship no more than an handful of trusty followers and a limited supply of food and building materials. You are here to begin a new life. As you select which island to settle, your future is already sealed, for each one has its own special characteristics.\nYour goal is to create a whole new world. Explore, construct, settle, trade and defend - that is the challenge that lies before you!\n\nAnno 1602 takes you into the world of construction strategy games. Build a realistic, living world for yourself according to your own ideas; your chosen strategy will decide the development and destiny of your towns and villages. Prove your diplomatic skills in your dealings with natives, your comrades and pirates too. Start by building up farms, plantations and small workshops to produce, then use your business acumen and begin to generate trade with your fellow players.\nBut beware, for with riches and prosperity also comes envy and anger! Train soldiers and build defensive structures to protect your property and wealth, or perhaps it may be wise to put your negotiation skills to use outside of business?",

Therefore, fewer technologies can be researched than in other Cossacks games, and there aren't as many different unit types for each country as before. On the other hand, Cossacks II allows a large number of units to be trained and it has many tactical options and an updated graphical engine.",

Shortly after docking, however, Jack's boat was greeted by artillery fire from a mysterious militia group swarming about the island.\n\nWith his boat destroyed, his money gone, and the gorgeous Valerie suddenly missing, Jack now finds himself facing an army of mercenaries amidst the wilds of the island, with nothing but a gun and his wits to survive. But the further he pushes into the lush jungle canopy, the stranger things become.\n\nJack encounters an insider within the militia group who reveals the horrific details of the mercenaries' true intentions.

In addition, players must follow strict protocol to ensure proper use of force. Players may not fire on suspects with lethal weapons unless the suspect points their firearm at a fellow officer or a civilian. Penalties are given for unauthorized use of force, injuries to hostages, officer incapacitation, and personal injury. On the higher difficulty levels, more points are required to pass the mission, with 100 being perfect. On the most difficult level, Elite, players need a 95/100 to pass, and will fail for killing even a single suspect, losing more than two team members without committing an infraction, or committing any infraction in addition to being injured.",

Alice's only possession in Rutledge is a stuffed rabbit. Ten years after Alice was committed to Rutledge, she finds herself sucked back into a Wonderland that has been twisted by her own broken mind.

        "summary": "Metal Gear is considered to be the progenitor of the stealth game genre, it was also the first video game designed by Hideo Kojima, who also directed many of the later Metal Gear sequels. A heavily altered port was produced for the Famicom/NES (without Kojima's involvement). A remade version based on the original MSX2 game was released as a bonus game in Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence for the PlayStation 2 and, as a result, is also included in Metal Gear Solid HD Collection and Metal Gear Solid: The Legacy Collection.\n\nThe game revolves around a special forces operative codenamed Solid Snake who goes into a solo infiltration mission into the fortified state of Outer Heaven to destroy Metal Gear, a bipedal walking tank capable of launching nuclear missiles from anywhere in the world.\n\nThe player must navigate the main character, a military operative codenamed Solid Snake, through various locations, while avoiding visual contact and direct confrontation with patrolling guards. If the player is seen, the game enters the \"Alert Mode.\" In this situation, Snake must escape from enemy's sight in order to resume infiltration. The method of escaping varies depending on the circumstances behind discovery:\n\nIf Snake is seen and only a single exclamation mark appears over an enemy's head, only the enemies in the player's present screen will attack and Snake can escape by simply moving to an adjacent screen.\nHowever, if two exclamation marks appear over the enemy (or the player triggers an alarm by being spotted by a camera, infrared sensor or by using an unsuppressed weapon), reinforcements from off-screen will appear as well. Snake can only escape by eliminating all incoming enemies, going outdoors, or by entering an elevator.\nThe player starts the game unarmed, but eventually acquires firearms such as a Beretta 92F and an M79 grenade launcher, as well as explosives such as remote control missiles and landmines. Ammo and supplies for weapons are limited, but are replenished by picking up ammunition caches or additional supplies. Weapons can not only be used to kill enemies, but also to clear obstacles such as hollow walls and electrified floors. Snake can also use his fists to punch and defeat patrolling enemies. Occasionally, if the player defeats a guard with punches without alerting anyone, the defeated guard will yield a single unit of rations or an ammo box that can be picked up. In addition to enemy guards, the player will also be confronted by mercenaries who will challenge the player to combat, serving as the boss characters.\n\nThe enemy base consists of three different buildings, with multiple floors (including basement levels) within them. The player uses key cards and other items to unlock doors and explore new areas. Each door will only open to its corresponding key cards. Information can be obtained by rescuing hostages being held within the buildings. After rescuing five hostages, the player's rank will increase by one star (with the maximum rank being four stars), allowing for increased carrying capacity and maximum health. However, if a hostage is killed, the player is demoted to the previous rank.\n\nA transceiver is available for the player to communicate with their commanding officer, Big Boss, or one of the resistance members operating covertly near Outer Heaven (Schneider, Diane, and Jennifer). Each of Snake's allies specializes in a specific subject. The player must keep track of their allies' frequency numbers in order to contact them. All of the radio messages are dependent on the rooms where the player is located.",

        "summary": "Final Fantasy Type-0 is set within Orience, a land divided between four nations or \"Crystal States\". Each nation has crystals of power based on the Four Symbols, which are in turn their national emblems. The Dominion of Rubrum uses the Vermillion Bird Crystal, which controls magic; the Milites Empire controls the White Tiger Crystal, containing the power of science and weapons; the Kingdom of Concordia uses the Azure Dragon Crystal, containing the power of Dragons; and the Lorican Alliance is home to the Black Tortoise Crystal, containing the power of shielding. Each nation has an academy, or Peristylium, to research and protect the country's respective crystal. The crystals have the ability to mark humans as their countries' servants. These servants, called l'Cie, are branded with a symbol and are given a \"Focus\", a task to complete. While blessed with long life and the ability to transform into crystal, l'Cie are cursed to lose their memories over time. The people of Orience also lose their memories of the dead, so they will not be held back by any past regrets and continue strengthening their souls through conflict, a mechanism put in place by the crystals for the convenience of the deities who crafted them. The main aim of many characters is to become Agito, a legendary figure who will appear and save the world from Tempus Finis, an apocalyptic event that will destroy Orience.",

        "summary": "FINAL FANTASY IV: THE AFTER YEARS is a direct sequel to FINAL FANTASY IV. It is a Japanese-style role-playing game released in episodic format. The game uses mechanics, assets and graphics from various releases of FINAL FANTASY IV.\n\nThe characters travel across the world map (although the whole map only becomes accessible in the final Tale The Crystals) fighting random enemies, enter towns to rest, buy equipment and talk to other characters, go to various dungeons for items and boss fights.\n\nThe battles use the same Active Time Battle (ATB) system from FINAL FANTASY IV, but it is improved in several ways. The class system from FINAL FANTASY IV largely remains the same but it has been tweaked and many new abilities have been added to the characters.\n\nThe WiiWare port of the game features several graphical enhancements over the mobile version, including larger screen resolution, clearer menu screens and fonts, and improved character portraits. The English localization follows the precedents set by the DS remake of Final Fantasy IV, featuring similar writing and making use of the same translations of names and terminology. A few edits have been made to the English version, including the modification of Ceodore's official character artwork to Westernize his face, as well as alterations to several female characters in order to make their clothing less revealing.",

        "summary": "FINAL FANTASY IV is a 3D remake of the classic Japanese RPG that was first released for SNES as FINAL FANTASY II in the North America.\n\nUnlike the many subsequent ports (to Playstation, GameBoy Advance, etc.), this release is a full remake, programmed from scratch with real-time 3D graphics. The characters have a \"super-deformed\" touch. There is also voice acting during cut-scenes. A new option has been added to the menu, which allows the player to read a conversation between party members and receive advice from them.\n\nIt also features many gameplay additions. The difficulty level has been increased, not only beyond the difficulty of the Western SNES release (which was reduced compared to Japanese original and subsequent ports), but even beyond the original difficulty. The party members are still bound by class, but they can now hunt for so-called \"augments\", which can be found or stolen from enemies and which grant the characters additional bonus abilities, resistances, spells that their class would normally not allow, etc.\n\nBeside those major changes, there are also plenty of minor additions. It is possible to obtain bonus items after exploring every corner and filling 100% of an area map; Rydia, the summoner girl, has a new monster summon who can be customized in various ways; there is a new quest involving the \"naming\" moogle of the original game, etc.",

The destruction of the Yuke Crystal during the Great War, with the Yuke Tribe suffering apparent annihilation, had at last brought the victorious Lilties dominion over the world as they bring it into a new age of science and reason through machines called \"crystal reactors,\" with the use of magic outlawed and rule over the Clavats and few Selkies who comply to the new order. In this new era of imbalance exists a rare breed of powerful beings called \"crystal bearers\", whose seemingly magical abilities have led them to be feared and scorned by the public.",

Centuries have passed and the would-be master of Pureland have managed to create a rift in the galaxy, sending the Pureland Water Entity to devour all that stands in its path. You must journey through past, present, and future to find the 13 pieces of the now-divided Talon. Only then can you save the universe from total destruction.",

FFXI was the world's first cross-console MMORPG, available for Windows, PlayStation 2, Xbox 360 and Steam.\n\nSince its release in 2002, it has become the most financially successful title in the Final Fantasy series. Due to the nature of online RPGs, FFXI differs in that the player is not the only hero. Instead, each player creates a customizable character and adventures through the world of Vana'diel with other players; leveling up, exploring, completing missions, quests, and much more.\n\nLeveling up requires a group of people working together in what is called a Party, with each participant contributing their own skills to help take down a foe and gain Experience points. Battles occur in real-time, taking the ATB system to a new level, which was emulated again to a certain extent in Final Fantasy XII.",

The game first appeared only in Japan on Nintendo's Super Famicom (known internationally as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System).\n\nIt has been ported with minor differences to Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo's Game Boy Advance. An original video animation produced in 1994 called FINAL FANTASY: Legend of the Crystals serves as a sequel to the events depicted in the game. It was released for the PlayStation Network on April 6, 2011, in Japan. An enhanced port of the game, with new high-resolution graphics and a touch-based interface, was released for iPhone and iPad on March 28, 2013, and for Android on September 25, 2013.\n\nFINAL FANTASY V has been praised for the freedom of customization that the player has over the characters, achieved through the greatly expanded Job System. Despite being released only in Japan, the Super Famicom version sold more than two million copies. The PlayStation version has earned \"Greatest Hits\" status, selling more than 350,000 copies.",

As with Shogun the game is split into two sections – the turn-based campaign map wherein the player is required to make strategic decisions, recruit and move armies, besiege settlements, fight naval battles and employ agents such as emissaries, spies and assassins to aid with diplomacy, offer alliances or bribes, or execute rather more clandestine actions.\n\nReligion is important in the game and whether a faction is Muslim, Orthodox or Christian will affect allegiances and public loyalty – as a catholic nation the player must carry out the wishes of the Papal States, embarking on a holy war if need be or else run the risk of excommunication. If public order and loyalty should fall too low in a particular region a rebellion or a civil war may occur – in these situations the player may decide to side with the rebels or the current rulers to quell the rebellion or overthrow a tyrannous regime-",

        "summary": "An action game spin-off in the Total Warrior series. Play as a mighty Spartan trooper, and battle through hordes of enemies in large environments, while working with allies. Use ultra-violent special attacks to mow down entire groups of foes at once, with ridiculously bloody effect. \n \nThe game has a fast-paced, arcade-like, mission-based gameplay. In each mission, you must succeed in minor goals like killing the generals of the opposition, escorting sappers to blow up enemy siege weaponry and preventing the enemy from making to behind your borders. The storyline progresses through cutscenes, shown in-between each mission. \n \nDepending on how you succeed in your mission, you get \"tokens\", which you can use to upgrade the health, damage or power of your character. The player is capable of doing special moves, which can be learned throughout the game. Some of the special moves gain their powers through the spartan gods, that aid the player in his battle. During the game, you can find different weapons like swords, bows and spears, and of course, shields.",

In Medieval II, you were only given a tantalizing glimpse of South America, but in Kingdoms, vast tracts of land in both North and South America have been opened up for you to conquer. All-new factions from the New World are also now fully playable, including the Aztecs, Apaches, and Mayans. \nAlong with the new maps in the Britannia, Teutonic, Crusades, and New World Campaigns, there are 13 new factions to play, over 110 units to control, and 50 building types, adding up to 80 hours of new gameplay. Kingdoms also offers new multiplayer maps and hotseat multiplayer, a first for the Total War series, allowing you to play one-versus-one campaign games on the same computer.",

The player takes the role of a US soldier, part of the allied force fighting against outnumbering Chinese forces vying for control of the island.\n\nThe game centers on a campaign narrative that gives the player a variety of roles in the allied forces ranging from a Marine Infantry, tank commander, Special Forces and helicopter captain. The game has an incredible realistic depiction of war with careful attention to the detail of the weapons, equipment and tactics of the armed forces. The action is varied from intense fire fights through to slower pace tactical decision making on how to best tackle the mission objectives.",

Each of the Vikings has a unique set of abilities:\n\nErik can run faster than the other two, can jump, and can bash through some walls (and enemies) with his helmet.\nBaleog can kill enemies with his sword, or from a distance with his bow (and a \"life-time supply of arrows\"). The bow can also be used to hit switches from a distance.\nOlaf can block enemies and their projectiles with his shield, and use his shield as a hang glider. Olaf's shield can also be used as a stepping stone for Erik to enable him to reach higher ground, which would not be possible without the shield.",

Slightly confused and disoriented, Simon escapes the temple with the help of his new fairy godmother.\n\nOnce again explore with Simon a vast fantastical world and help him find a way back home by uncovering the secrets of 'The Nexus'. Do this before your arch nemesis, Sordid, can use its power for more evil means.\n\nMeet up with favorite characters once more such as The Swampling, Calypso and the Woodworm! Enjoy over 40 hours of gameplay filled with ribald jokes, sly humour and 'off the cuff' quips.\n\nThis is full \"talkie\" version of the game. You can turn the subtitles on if you prefer subtitled version.",

Objects that can be interacted with are highlighted by eyeball icons. The previous games in the series have mostly been about exploring the town and solving puzzles, but this installment has much more combat involved. There are more enemies in a given area, spread in cramped spaces. The main character mostly uses a standard Silent Hill arsenal of weapons, such as the steel pipe, pistol and a golf club.",

New to the series are a depiction of Silent Hill's demonic alter-dimension as a world of ice, and the removal of weapons from the game: when the monsters come out, Harry must literally run for his life. Between scenes, the game will cut to a psychiatrist's office, who asks personal questions about Harry and his past experiences.

        "summary": "Silent Hill: Downpour is the eighth Silent Hill video game installment and the last fully-released video game in the series. Just like its predecessors, Downpour combines exploring abandoned surroundings, talking to characters, and solving puzzles, set against a slow, psychological horror theme. Different from the previous game Silent Hill: Shattered Memories is the return of combat. The player often has to fight off monsters using a variety of weapons, but he can carry only one melee and one ranged weapon who can deteriorate over time. Entirely new to the series is the introduction of a weather system: there is a full day and night cycle and rain often warns the player of danger that is approaching. It is possible to hide until the weather becomes better again.",

The game tells the story of a futuristic confederation protected by an elite band of mercenaries: Dead Echo. When Dead Echo members Grayson Hunt and Ishi Sato learn they've been working for the wrong side, they're betrayed by their commander and exiled to the far reaches of the galaxy. In Bulletstorm, Grayson and Ishi find themselves surrounded by hordes of mutants and flesh eating gangs in an abandoned paradise. They have two objectives: get off the planet alive, and exact revenge on the man who sent them there.\n\nPlayers step into the role of Grayson Hunt complete with an arsenal of over-the-top combat moves and outrageously large guns. Bulletstorm's array of distinct 'skillshots' produces unprecedented levels of frantic gameplay and yell-inducing satisfaction. The skillshot system rewards players for inciting mayhem in the most creative way possible. The more insane the skillshot, the more points players collects to upgrade their character and unlock weapons, which then allows them to execute even more creative moves and exaggerated skillshots.",

        "summary": "Set in the realm of brutal Greek mythology, God of War III is a single-player game that allows players to take on the climatic role of the ex-Spartan warrior, Kratos, as he scales through the intimidating heights of Mt. Olympus and the dark depths of Hell to seek revenge on those who have betrayed him. Armed with double-chained blades, and an array of new weapons and magic for this iteration of the trilogy, Kratos must take on mythology's darkest creatures while solving intricate puzzles throughout his merciless quest to destroy Olympus. Utilizing a new game engine built from the ground up and state-of-the-art visual technologies, the development team behind God of War III has made standard-setting strides in giving players the realistic feel of actually being on the battlegrounds. With texture resolutions quadrupling since God of War II on PlayStation 2 computer entertainment system, God of War III, in its debut on the PS3 system, will feature fluid, life-like characters, as well as dynamic lighting effects, a robust weapon system, and world-changing scenarios that will truly bring unmistakable realism to Kratos' fateful quest. Players will have a chance to join battles on a grand scale that is four times larger than its predecessor.",

A prominent gameplay element new to this game is reflex time, an ability which slows down the game world while still allowing the player to aim and react at normal speeds. This effect is used to simulate the player character's superhuman reflexes, and is represented by stylized visual effects, such as bullets in flight that cause air distortion or interact with the game's particle system. Other new features include the ability to bash open doors by using the melee function, as well as blast them open with explosives, and the ability to smash crates, some of which contain supplies.",

As players' characters develop, the world reacts to them and their actions. People comment on their successes, failures, appearances and behaviors.

The main difference to other racing events is, that the player drives not alone, but has a front-seat passenger with him, who announces when to turn. The game features overall 98 courses, but some of those are just variations of the same. Also on board is the iconic ability to turn back time after screwing up.\n\nIn contrast to Dirt 2, in this installment there are other playing modes than the career available, e.g. a single race. But the career is still the heart of the game; here the player tunes his car, participates in races and earns experience points, which are used to unlock new cars. There are six different race modes to solve during the career; e.g. regular races and \"trailblazer\" (no passenger available). Two of those are newly introduced: drift tournaments and Gymkhana, which are basically confined areas with a lot of stunt opportunities - the goal is to perform as many as possible in a limited time. Additionally every mode has special tricky bonus goals which reward more experience when fulfilled.",

In Assassin's Creed Revelations, master assassin Ezio Auditore walks in the footsteps of his legendary mentor, Altair, on a journey of discovery and revelation. It is a perilous path - one that will take Ezio to Constantinople, the heart of the Ottoman Empire, where a growing army of Templars threatens to destabilize the region.\n\nIn addition to Ezio's award-winning story, the acclaimed online multiplayer experience from Assassin's Creed Brotherhood returns; refined and expanded, with more modes, more maps and more characters that allow players to test their assassin skills against others from around the world. The latest chapter in the Assassin's Creed saga also includes revolutionary gameplay, allowing players to manipulate the construct of Desmond's memories and the Animus to decipher the mysteries of his past and gain insight into the future.",

BioShock Infinite features a range of environments that force the player to adapt, with different weapons and strategies for each situation. Interior spaces feature close combat with enemies, but unlike previous games set in Rapture, the setting of Infinite contains open spaces with emphasis on sniping and ranged combat against as many as fifteen enemies at once.",

Like its predecessor, the game is a primarily story-driven shooter with heavy stealth elements. Artyom may carry up to three weapons at a time, however bullets are scarce and valuable to the point that higher grade bullets are, in fact, the Metro's currency. When dealing with armed opponents, stealth is encouraged and it is wise to save ammunition for the many mutant creatures encountered in combat. In many situations the player can choose between straightforward shooting and stealth, also having the option for lethal or non-lethal enemy takedowns.",

Despite ascending to the title of the god of war, Kratos remains haunted by nightmarish visions. One such vision compels him to embark on a new journey when he witnesses his mother, Callisto, imprisoned in Atlantis under the dominion of the sea god Poseidon. Against Athena's counsel to ignore the vision, Kratos sets forth to unravel his past and, in the process, rescue his long-lost brother, Deimos, from the clutches of the god of death, Thanatos.\n\nThis second instalment for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) maintains a gameplay style akin to its predecessor, introducing a handful of new mechanics. Kratos wields his trusty Blades of Athena in this quest, now augmented with a new magic known as Thera's Bane, amplifying the potency of his attacks. The game also introduces several new magical items and a fresh secondary weapon. In addition to the captivating story mode, Ghost of Sparta offers the \"Temple of Zeus,\" a location where players can spend orbs acquired in the Battle Arena to acquire various art and other bonuses.\"",

These entities have the power to enable time travel, allowing Kratos to prevent his betrayal, and ultimately seek revenge on Zeus.",

        "summary": "Kratos makes his inaugural appearance on a portable gaming platform in the third instalment of the God of War series. Chains of Olympus serves as a prequel, unfolding its narrative a decade before the events in the original God of War. While retaining the familiar gameplay dynamics of its predecessors, subtle modifications enhance the overall experience. Kratos embarks on a journey through various levels, engaging in relentless combat against foes and formidable bosses, deciphering puzzles based on manipulating boxes, and participating in quick-time events. Throughout his odyssey, he amasses red orbs to fortify his weapons and abilities, secures Gorgon eyeballs to augment his health, and acquires Phoenix feathers to amplify his magical prowess.\n\nThe game's controls underwent refinement to harmonize with the reduced button configuration of the PSP. Dodging, for instance, now necessitates the utilization of both shoulder buttons and the analogue stick. The iconic Blades of Chaos, synonymous with the God of War series, make a return, accompanied by an array of new weapons and magical spells such as the Sun Shield, Efreet spell, and Light of Dawn.\n\nThe narrative unfolds as the Gods dispatch Kratos to the city of Attica, charging him with the defence against an encroaching Persian army. However, as Morpheus unleashes chaos, Kratos finds himself compelled to harness his formidable powers to once again rescue the world from impending doom.",

Floods, storms, bush-fires, tornadoes and hurricanes have driven people from towns and cities into safe zones as extreme weather wreaks havoc, creating thousands of square miles of dangerous uninhabitable areas. People turn to renewable energy in the face of the destruction caused by global warming. But these danger zones become a playground for a new breed of racer. With a stockpile of fuel to be burned, adrenaline junkies head into the wilderness to compete against each other in spectacular races against themselves and the elements.",

To deal with the large amount of enemies, the player has access to many typical WWII-weapons like the German MP40 or K98 rifle. In addition, during the course of the game he finds the medallion and learns four powers. While at first entering the Veil only allows him so see enemies more clearly and use strange flying creatures as bombs, he is later able to slow down time, surround himself with a protective shield or make himself stronger. However, the medallion's powers drain its energy, which needs to be refilled at power-spots that are nearly invisible in the real world.",

        "summary": "Eat Lead: The Return of Matt Hazard is a third-person shooter video game for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 video game consoles. The game was developed by Vicious Cycle Software and published by D3 Publisher.\n\nEat Lead pits players in the role of the title character, a \"legendary\" gaming hero who is \"returning to glory\" in a new video game, some 25 years after his debut game and 6 years after his last game. In reality, the Matt Hazard character is in his first video game, with a history made up by D3 Publisher to chronicle the character's rise and fall in popularity. The Return of Matt Hazard marks Hazard's fictitious \"comeback\" to the gaming scene. Hazard is voiced by Will Arnett, while Neil Patrick Harris voices his nemesis Wallace \"Wally\" Wellesley.\n\nThe game itself is a parody of action-gaming clichés. The October 2008 debut trailer was done as a Behind the Music spoof called Inside the Game complete with Jim Forbes narration. It chronicles Matt Hazard's successes and hardships, and mirrors the progression of the Duke Nukem series of games, from early 8-bit to modern consoles.[1]\n\nThe cast of Eat Lead received a nomination in the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards, under the category for \"Best Cast\"",

        "summary": "After being promoted by Michael Corleone to Don of New York, players expand to new cities, as they build up their families through extorting businesses, monopolizing illegal crime rings and defeating new families in an effort to become the most powerful mob family in America. To help players manage their empire, The Godfather II introduces \"The Don's View\" - an innovative strategy meta-game that allows players to oversee the entire world as they grow the family business. Using the Don's View, players will be able to build, defend and expand their crime rings, while keeping an eye on the movements and plans of the rival families. Players will also learn to master the business of organized crime by building a family of Made Men, hiring crew, handing out orders, and promoting their best men up the ranks. Set in a stunning open-world environment, The Godfather II expands on the popular gameplay mechanics of the first game and doubles down on the series' signature BlackHand control scheme, which now features even more visceral hand-to-hand brutality at your fingertips, introducing a new combo system, pressure tactics and executions. In The Godfather II, players fight alongside their hand-picked crew, who have their own skills and expertise. Each family member specializes in a specific field such as demolitions, arson, engineering, first-aid and more. As The Don you control the family, sending some of your men on missions while heading off into action with others. The combination of strategic organized crime gameplay and brutal BlackHand action promises to set The Godfather II apart from other open-world games. Play The Godfather II online multiplayer modes and become the true Don of Dons. Take your money, weapons, and crew from your single-player experience online and wage mob warfare against up to 16 players from around the world. Play as one of the family's crew specialists and put your best strategies to the test as you take over territory and strike back at rivals.

        "summary": "America's Army is the name given to a game technology platform used to develop first person shooter (FPS) games published in 2002 by the U.S. Army. The game is branded as a strategic communication device, designed to allow young Americans to virtually explore the Army at their own pace and according to their interests to determine if soldiering matches their needs, interests and abilities. America's Army represents the first large-scale use of game technology by the U.S. government as a platform for strategic communication and the first use of game technology in support of U.S. Army recruiting.\n\nThe America's Army concept was conceived in 1999 by Colonel Casey Wardynski; the Army's Chief Economist and Professor at the United States Military Academy.[2] Wardynski envisioned \"using computer game technology to provide the public a virtual Soldier experience that was engaging, informative and entertaining.\"[3] America's Army was managed by two other U.S. Army officers serving with Wardynski at the Office of Economic and Manpower Analysis (OEMA): Major Chris Chambers and Major Bret Wilson.\n\nThe Windows version 1.0, subtitled Recon, was first released on July 4, 2002. As of January 2014, there have been over 41 versions and updates released, including updates to America's Army: Proving Grounds which was released in August 2013. All versions have been developed on the Unreal Engine. The game is financed by the U.S. government and distributed by free download.\n\nAccording to game historian Carrie McLeroy America's Army has \"grown in ways its originators couldn't have imagined\".[3] Dozens of government training and simulation applications using the America's Army platform have been developed to train and educate U.S. Army soldiers.[4] America's Army has also been used to deliver virtual soldiering experiences to participants at events, such as air shows, amusement parks, and sporting events around the country. The America's Army series has also been expanded to include versions for Xbox and Xbox 360, arcade, and mobile applications published through licensing arrangements.[5][6]",

You're going into combat against the best the enemy can offer, but you've got the most advanced fighting helicopter in the world at your fingertips, packed with a devastating array of lethal weapons and state-of-the art technology.\n\nYou're ready to rock and roll but so is the enemy! They're waiting for you with combat helicopters of their own, backed up by radar-guided anti-aircraft guns and missiles and fixed wing aircraft. It's not going to be a cakewalk but you and your Apache are up to the challenge. Across four theaters of war-- Fort Hood where you train and then in war zones in Cyprus, Yemen, and Korea--you will fly the most fearsome helicopter that has ever been designed against enemies on land, sea, and air.\n\nApache Longbow took flying simulators to the next level. The developers constructed the flight model with fanatical attention to detail, going so far as to bring in Apache pilots to fly the in-game chopper and offer their feedback on how real the experience felt. Every flight simulator enthusiast will be pleased with the complexity and realism this game has to offer. Meanwhile, to make the game more accessible there is also an arcade mode where the flight mechanics aren't nearly as realistic, but there's still tons of fun to be had. So whichever you are - a slow-and-low hardcore sim fan or someone who just likes to fly about and blow things up - this game has something for you.",

The game was played in a large, seamless 3D virtual world which could host thousands of players' characters at a time.\n\nReleased on November 2, 1999, it was the third major MMORPG to be released and was developed at the same time as Ultima Online and Everquest.

        "summary": "Circle of Blood is a 2D adventure game played from a third-person perspective. The player uses a point-and-click interface to interact with the environment and to guide protagonist George Stobbart through the game's world. To solve puzzles and progress in the game, the player collects items that may be combined with one another, used on the environment, or given to non-player characters. The protagonist converses with NPCs via dialogue trees presented through \"conversation icons\" to learn about the game's puzzles and plot. Clues and other information are obtained by clicking on items in the inventory and on objects in the environment. The player navigates with a map, to which new locations are added as the story unfolds. Unlike in most adventure games at the time, the protagonist's death is possible, after which the player starts from the last save point.",

Civ IV: Beyond the Sword also includes ten new civilizations, sixteen new leaders, five new wonders, and a variety of new units that offer even more fun and exciting ways for players to expand their civilization's power as they strive for world domination.\n\nExpanded Epic Game: Adds a massive increase of new units, buildings, and technologies to the epic game with a tremendous amount of effort focused on the late game.\n\nNew Game Scenarios: 11 new scenarios custom-designed by the team at Firaxis and some members of the Civ Fan Community.\n\nNew Civilizations: 10 new civilizations, such as Portugal, Babylonians, and Netherlands and their associated unique units and buildings.\n\nMore Civilization Leaders: Sixteen new leaders, both for the new civilizations as well as additional leaders for existing civilizations, including Hammurabi of the Babylonians, Abraham Lincoln of the United States, and Sitting Bull of the Native Americans.\n\nCorporations: A new game feature similar to religion allows players to found companies and spread them throughout the world.

In addition, new resolutions expand the available diplomatic options.\n\nAdvanced Starts: A major fan request, this new feature enables players to 'buy' components of a custom-tailored empire and begin play in the later part of the game, allowing one to experience many of the new features of the expansion in a shorter amount of time.\n\nAdvanced AI: The greatly-enhanced AI now relies more on smart play and less on handicap bonuses to remain competitive, providing a more consistent challenge throughout the course of the game, both economically and militarily. The ways in which the AI attempt to achieve victory have also been expanded.",

        "summary": "Civilization III: Conquests is the second and final expansion for the award-winning and best-selling computer game Civilization III. It was published in 2003. This expansion added eight new civilizations to the game, and including the eight civilizations from Play the World this brings the total number of playable civilizations up to thirty-one (the maximum supported by the game). The new civilizations are the Byzantines, the Dutch, the Hittites, the Incans, the Mayans, the Portuguese and the Sumerians. In addition to these playable civilizations, graphics for the Austrians are present in the editor so one can replace an existing civilization.\n\nTwo new special traits are added in this pack: seafaring and agricultural. Many of the new civilizations take advantage of these new traits (e.g. the Sumerians are Scientific and Agricultural), and some old civilizations are changed to more appropriate ones (e.g. the English have been changed from Expansionist and Commercial to Seafaring and Commercial).\n\nNew governments have also been added to the game, Feudalism and Fascism, and new Wonders of the World such as the Statue of Zeus and the Mausoleum of Mausollos. Four new bonus resources have been included, two of which provide food bonuses to previously unprofitable terrain. Oases can now be found in deserts, tropical fruit in jungles, sugar on plains and hills, and tobacco on grasslands and hills. In addition, two new types of terrain have been added. These are marshes and volcanoes. Players cannot construct cities on marshes, and cannot improve volcanoes in any way. Like jungles and flood plains, cities that have at least 1 citizen working a marsh may succumb to disease. Volcanoes may periodically erupt, destroying all improvements and cities and killing any units in some or all adjacent squares.\n\nThe centerpiece of this expansion pack, however, was the inclusion of scenarios, intended for multiplayer gaming. Unlike the main (\"epic\") game, these scenarios took much less time to play, and focused on a specific period in history.\n\nGenerally the reception of this expansion pack was much better than that of Play the World.\n\nOne year after Conquests was launched, the latest Civilization III stand-alone version, Civilization III: Complete was also released. This version included Civilization III, Play the World and Conquests. This version also includes several patches.\n\nTwo years later, in 2005 Civilization IV was released.",

Set in the early 1920s, the action takes place in the Irish countryside and revolves around a plagued fellow by the name of Patrick Galloway. Full of terrifying twists and turns, the game follows Galloway as he's haunted by specters--an ailment that will slowly drive him to the brink of insanity over the course of the game's many chapters. He'll have both magic and some powerful weaponry to help him through his journey, but as the plot thickens, so does the level of difficulty. Blending fever-pitch action with a deep, thorough story, Clive Barker's Undying is chilly enough to keep you up at night and addicting enough to occupy you for weeks.",

Selecting from a variety of new units and an arsenal of new high-tech weaponry, players will use whatever it takes to remove enemy Generals from power.\n\nTo emerge victorious, even the most experienced C&C Generals' veteran must discover new tactics and strategies to take full advantage of-and learn to defend against-the world's most lethal weapons. With the addition of new units, structures, and upgrades-plus enhanced controls, Battle Honors, and a variety of new online features-Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour gives players the firepower they'll need for global domination.\n\nWith 15 new missions, players may be tasked to destroy the U.S. fleet in the Mediterranean, root out a splinter cell in Cairo, infiltrate a U.S. intelligence building, or send in special operatives to capture weapons of mass destruction. An all-new Generals Challenge mode allows players to control any of 9 new armies in battle against 9 AI generals.\n\nThe ultimate goal will be to successfully make their way through all 9 enemy Generals, and unlock a select number of their armies for play in Skirmish and Online modes and prove once and for all they are the Ultimate Modern Warfare General.",

This is the second text adventure with illustrating graphics released by Sierra. Communicating with the game works via entering commands which tell the player's alter ego where to go and what to do. Since the parser is a very basic one it only understands two-word commands. Two years after its initial release, the game was renamed \"Adventure in Serenia\" for its PC release. This suggested sequel was, however, exactly the same game as in its previous incarnation.",

The Silencer's escape pod is picked up by a freighter that is headed to the WEC penitentiary mining facility on the Moon, where political dissidents and Resistance members are held. The mining operation there is the key to destabilizing the entire WEC\nstructure from within, and this is why Chairman Draygan himself is overseeing the program. The Resistance has also managed to install a cell on the Moon and is trying to delay the Di-Corellium extraction as much as possible. All the pieces are in place and it is up to you to make the first move - and the last one.\n\nCompared to its predecessor, Crusader: No Regret is much more straightforward, and with a higher emphasis on action. This is by no means a bad thing, because sometimes good old-fashioned shotgun diplomacy is the right solution to the problem, and the Silencer is an unquestionable expert in this field.",

Unlike the original game, the missions of Covert Operations can be played at any time and in any order, and are not accompanied by mission briefing cut-scenes. It added two new units to the game, and the new missions are more difficult than those of the original. The add-on pack features the DOS version's soundtrack, which includes music that was absent from the Windows 95 (or Gold Edition) version. Covert Operations was originally needed to unlock secret missions, which were later enabled by a patch to the main game.",

Your stomach sinks as your eyes pan across the Shivan flagship's massive body. Then it begins. Swarms of fighters pour from the belly of the flagship and scream towards you. You are about to discover everything you thought you knew about space combat just changed.",

        "summary": "Behold disciples of Nod, for the end is soon upon us. Electronic Arts’ award-winning and best-selling Tiberium saga is coming to a powerful conclusion with Command & Conquer 4, which will introduce a multitude of innovations to the classic fast and fluid Command & Conquer gameplay, while retaining the core compulsions that fans have come to love over the series’ history.\n\nIt is the year 2062 and humanity is at the brink of extinction. Tiberium, the mysterious, alien crystalline structure that has infested Earth for decades and served as the primary reason for years of relentless conflict between the Global Defense Initiative (GDI) and the Brotherhood of Nod, is close to rendering the planet uninhabitable. Mankind is on the verge of extinction when Kane, Nod’s prophetic leader, emerges from seclusion to deliver GDI the message that he has developed a system that could control Tiberium and harness its power. But he cannot build this \"Tiberium Control Network\" without GDI’s cooperation. Thus, the two opposing factions – GDI and Nod – inevitably find themselves in desperation for the same cause: to stop Tiberium from extinguishing mankind.\n\nAfter 15 years, the network is nearly complete, Tiberium is under strict control and our revitalized, newly terraformed planet is on the cusp of a new age of prosperity and progress. It is then that the world’s citizens begin to seriously ponder why Kane chose to help, and what will he want in return. These questions and more lead to the dramatic final act of the Tiberium saga.\n\nWith a multitude of innovative new features to the fast and fluid C&C gameplay, Command & Conquer 4 offers players an entirely new way to play C&C. An all-in-one mobile base, persistent player progression across all game modes that is constantly updated in a real-time online profile, a 3-class system for each of the two factions, co-operative play, and a 5v5 objective-based multiplayer mode that promotes teamwork and social interaction, make Command & Conquer 4 unlike any other C&C experience.",

Hours ago, the base on Mars began receiving incoherent distress messages from Phobos, while Deimos has disappeared completely. With all attempts to establish contact failing, you and your team have been dispatched to investigate. Upon arrival, you secure the perimeter as the rest of your team enters the facility. As you stand guard, your radio crackles with the sound of gunfire, cracking bones and blood-curdling screams and eventually falls silent. Alone, with no way off the planet or means to defend yourself other than your trusty pistol, there’s only one way out - into the complex of death and the horrors that await you within. If you plan to get out of here alive you must fend off the hordes of demonic imps, haunting spectres and your undead, former comrades waiting to tear you limb from limb.

It is the second multiplayer-focused game in the Quake series after Quake III Arena.\n\nQuake Wars features similar gameplay to Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, but with the addition of controllable vehicles and aircraft as well as multiple AI deployables, asymmetric teams, much larger maps and the option of computer-controlled bot opponents. Unlike the previous Enemy Territory games, Quake Wars is a commercial release rather than a free download.\n\nEnemy Territory: Quake Wars received mostly positive reviews upon release, although it received some criticism on consoles.",

New businesses are flourishing, bringing financial strength and political influence to a growing economy.\n\nHowever, life in the narrow, overpopulated alleyways and streets of the towns also has its downsides: epidemics and diseases are spreading, and thieves and highwaymen lie in wait to get their piece of the wealth.

The story receives further augmentation in the form of nine new areas and sixteen additional quests. Characters such as Briar Rose and Scythe, who played only minor roles in the original game, are now given more importance and are included in certain main and side quests. Other character-based augmentations include the voice of the antagonist, Jack of Blades, sounding deeper, harsher and more demonic, and the ability to uncover (and resolve) the murder mystery of Lady Grey's sister. The updated edition of the game also applied fixes for certain glitches, such as the \"dig glitch,\" in which the protagonist would move backward each time he used the shovel, pushing him through solid objects and sometimes trapping him.",

        "summary": "FIFA Football 2002 (known as FIFA Soccer 2002: Major League Soccer in North America, and FIFA 2002: Road to FIFA World Cup in Japan), commonly known as FIFA 2002, is a football video game released in 2001, produced by Electronic Arts and released by EA Sports. FIFA 2002 is the ninth game in the FIFA series.\n\nPower bars for passes were introduced, and dribbling reduced in order to attain a higher challenge level. The power bar can also be customised to suit the gamer's preference. The game also includes club emblems for many more European clubs as well as for major Dutch clubs such as PSV, AFC Ajax and Feyenoord, although there was no Dutch league of any kind (they were under the \"Rest of World\" header). This game also features, for the first time, the Swiss Super League, at the cost of excluding the Greek League. A card reward system licensed from Panini was also introduced where, after winning a particular competition, a star player card is unlocked. There is also a bonus game with the nations that had automatically qualified for the 2002 World Cup (France, Japan and South Korea), in which the player tries to improve the FIFA ranking of their chosen team by participating in international friendlies.\n\nMany of the international teams in the game are not licensed (some of them down to the players' names like the Netherlands), as well as smaller countries such as Barbados, who were only given numbers as player names. Also, to date, this was the last FIFA edition (not counting the World Cup versions) to feature the Japanese national team, since Japan Football Association would go on to concede exclusive rights to Konami's Pro Evolution Soccer series.\n\nFIFA Football 2002 ran for 10 years as the last FIFA to have only one person as cover, before Lionel Messi appeared alone on FIFA 13.",

He conducts missions which take him all over the world in various countries and climates, both indoor and outdoor, and his actions greatly affect the current state of the war. As the game progresses it is revealed that the specialists have been forced into biochemistry research for the Brotherhood's top secret \"Project Re-Genesis,\" An attempt to create genetically enhanced super-soldiers with the aid of Tiberium.\nAs the player plays through a mission, the in-game EVA, or Electronic Video Assistance, periodically updates with mission objectives. EVA logs and updates all objectives and their current status. Objectives are categorized into three categories: primary, secondary and tertiary. The completion of primary objectives are crucial for that mission's success. Secondary objectives are not required for mission completion, but may assist in game play. Tertiary missions, which are usually hidden, do not assist much in game play, but will affect your final \"rank\" at the end of each mission.",

        "summary": "Flight Unlimited III is a 1999 flight simulator video game developed by Looking Glass Studios and published by Electronic Arts. It allows players to pilot reproductions of real-world commercial and civilian aircraft in and around Seattle, Washington. Players may fly freely or engage in \"Challenge\" missions, such as thwarting a theft or locating Bigfoot. The development team built on the general aviation gameplay of Flight Unlimited II, with more detailed physics and terrain, more planes and a real-time weather system. Roughly half of Flight Unlimited II '​s team returned to work on the sequel, supported by new hires. \n \nLead designer Peter James described Flight Unlimited III '​s development as a struggle, thanks to a lack of interest from Electronic Arts and from Looking Glass's management. Placed in direct competition with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 and Fly!, the game failed to capture sufficient market share. It became one of Looking Glass's biggest commercial flops, with roughly 20,000 units sold in the United States during 1999. This contributed to the company's closure in 2000. The game was well received by critics, who praised its terrain rendering and dynamic weather. Its simulated physics were lauded by several reviewers, but others felt that the physics were imprecise, and that the game's system requirements were extremely high.",

The game also contains squad-based elements, having a charisma meter. The player gains charisma by performing heroic deeds in the resistance movement against the invading forces, like capturing a base or destroying vital supplies. The more charisma that is gained, the more squad-mates the character can recruit, including leaderless guerrillas and wounded Russian soldiers, up to a maximum of twelve.\n\nFreedom Fighters uses a simple method of controlling recruits in battle. In the game, the player can command recruits by giving them simple orders such as \"follow\", \"attack\" and \"defend\", but in most situations, they take care of themselves. Given the terrain of New York City after the initial invasion, the Resistance usually stations its soldiers in covered positions like craters and buildings.",

There are around 50 ghosts in total and each haunter has its own personality, strengths, and weaknesses. As the game develops the characters themselves will develop and grow. What's more, each one has its own unique set of powers - some can make the walls drip with blood while others can cut the lights in the room...Each time you scare a human or 'mortal', you will increase your plasm; the energy you need to scare them in the first place. Scare them too much and people will flee from the building, which will make your job more difficult.Ghost Master uses a unique AI engine, which gives the player a sense of natural human behaviour. The mortals will go about their everyday lives; cooking, going to work, arguing with each other... until they encounter the horrors you control! After facing these horrors they will become irrational, afraid, and sometimes even go insane! As well as horror the game also contains elements of humour.",

The game wasn't quite as well received as its predecessors, but at the time was widely considered to be the best racing simulation available.\n\nAn add-on to the game, called GP3-2000 or GP32k, was released by Hasbro which updated the game to the 2000 Formula One season. A few other changes were made as well including: updated damage physics including damage from on-circuit debris, improved AI, a new replay system, and EAX 3D-sound.\n\nSince the release of Grand Prix 4, the GP3 modding scene has slowly declined, and with the cracking of track editing for GP4 many track modders left GP3 for the newer title.",

        "summary": "All the circuits and drivers of the 1994 Formula 1 World Championship is recreated in Geoff Crammond's second racing simulation. The game is viewed from within the cockpit - external views are provided primarily for use in replays or demonstrations. Texture mapping and full detail in the rear view mirrors are available for almost every visible feature.\n\nThe game has 5 skill levels, 7 driving aids such as automatic brakes and a dotted 'ideal racing line' to follow available on lower skill levels, and variable race and practice session lengths. You will have to alter the car's setup to get the best possible car performance - this ranges from standard features such as brake balance and gear ratios onto more technical ones such as spring settings and the ride height. Multiplayer games involve either taking it in turns on a single computer, or on a linkup.",

Mankind emerged from the devastation of the Third World War (known in the game as \"The Sixteen-minutes War\", which almost wiped out the whole of humanity) and managed to colonize several planets across the galaxy. The Earth is ruled by a council called GCC (Global Central Command) that is formed by elected representatives and representatives of the mega corporations which rose to power after the fall of the Terran nations.\nThe game's plot revolves around the conflict between the Crayven Corporation and the Order of the New Dawn for the possession of the distant world of Krig 7-B. In the beginning of the game, the player assumes the role of Major Sarah Parker of the Crayven Corporation as she leads the Crayven forces in order to eliminate the presence of the \"Dawnies\" (her derogatory nickname in reference to followers of the Order). In the second campaign, the player assumes control of Deacon Jarred Stone in his attempt to drive the \"Crays\" from the surface of Krig 7-B. During the course of the campaign, however, both characters unravel a dark secret hidden within the depths of the planet, a secret that threatens all mankind, and turns out to be the reason for such interest in what seems to be a desolate fringe world.",

There are plenty of weapons to outfit your gear, even some hand-to-hand weapons. You can also add perks and flaws to further customize your gear. Stealth is a major concern in some missions. The game play feel is very different from the Mechwarrior series.\n\nSet in Dream Pod 9's Heavy Gear universe (it actually rivals the Battletech universe in complexity, though not nearly as famous), this game requires 3D accelerator with its \"Dark\" 3D engine. The gears are capable of very human-like movements, such as kneeling, crawling, and jumping.",

In August 2003, Microsoft purchased the rights to the High Heat franchise from 3DO, however, Microsoft has yet to develop a new title in the series.\n\nHigh Heat was traditionally known for possessing more simulation-style qualities than competitors World Series Baseball, All Star Baseball, or Triple Play Baseball, but frequently lagged behind in graphical quality. At the core of High Heat′s gameplay was its batter-pitcher interface, which was often hailed as the most realistic of its era.",

        "summary": "Red Alert 3: Uprising features four new mini-campaigns, giving players a deeper dive into the storyline's of the Soviets, the Allies, the Empire of the Rising Sun and a unique campaign centered on the origins of everyone’s favorite psionic Japanese schoolgirl commando, Yuriko Omega. Set in the aftermath of Red Alert 3, the Soviet Union is still reeling from its crushing defeat. The Empire of the Rising Sun is desperately trying to regain both honor and identity, and the seemingly victorious Allies find themselves in the midst of corruption and deceit within their own ranks.\n\nHow will the defeated Soviets react to the occupation and the presence of FutureTech, the mysterious company contracted by the Allies to develop new technologies in the Soviets’ homeland? How will the humiliated Empire of the Rising Sun rise up and defend itself against the former Soviet commanders who have invaded their territory in a post-war land grab? How will the Allied occupational forces quash the uprising of the former Imperial commanders? And who is the mysterious Japanese commando Yuriko Omega?\n\nFour New Mini-Campaigns – Battle your way through four all-new mini-campaigns featuring classic fast, furious, and fun C&C action. New stories and missions will cover all three factions, plus experience an entirely new, dungeon crawler campaign centered on the Empire’s commando, Yuriko Omega. Find out what the dubious tech company FutureTech is producing in their secret research facility, how the Soviets and the Empire deal with their inferior situation and witness Yuriko Omega’s rise from captive to deadly assassin.\n\nThe Largest Cast in the History of Video Games Gets Bigger and Better – Command & Conquer’s trademark live-action videos return with stunning HD cinematics telling the deep story of Uprising. Fan favorites like Gemma Atkinson and Ivana Milicevic will make their return to Red Alert, alongside Malcolm McDowell, wrestling legend Ric Flair, Jamie Chung, Holly Valance, Julia Ling and many more.",

Underground levels, however, do not have rival wizards. There are also several secret entrances to reach hidden levels, where the player can gain more spells and experience.\n\nAlso unlike its predecessor, the game proceeded by completing various missions such as reaching checkpoints and destroying specific buildings/monsters, rather than just simple accumulation of mana.",

        "summary": "You are the genetically engineered Clan Mechwarrior. The Clans are invading the Inner Sphere. Join either the Wolf Clan or the Jade Falcon Clan as they pursue their own agenda against the Inner Sphere and other Clans. Take your advanced Omnimechs into battle against all comers. Win high warrior ratings (by using less mechs or smaller mechs than needed, completing secondary objectives, etc.) and you'll get chance at a promotion trial where you face superior odds in an arena. If you win, you advance in rank. If you are very successfully, you can make it all the way up to Khan, leader of the Clan!\n\nMechwarrior II was developed in-house by Activision as the successor to their original Mechwarrior. While this time there are no dynamic campaign and mercenary actions, the Clan culture is integrated into the two campaigns. Different clans have different mechs and different rules, even different weapons. You can customize your mechs in order to use less than the \"par\" force in order to get a higher rating. The full 3D environment wasn't pretty as this was before the 3D accelerators made their debut, but it's still better than anything that came before. Let addition of NetMech allowed users to fight each other online. When 3D cards came along, special versions were created to take advantage of 3D texturing. While not QUITE as replayable as Mechwarrior, it's nonetheless a classic.\n\nIf you want them now, get the Titanium Edition, which is 3D accelerated.",

Like Myst III: Exile, Revelation combines pre-rendered graphics with digital video, but also features real-time 3D effects for added realism.\n\nThe plot of Revelation ties up loose ends from the original Myst. The player is summoned by Atrus, a man who creates links to other worlds known as Ages by writing special linking books. Almost twenty years earlier, Atrus' two sons nearly destroyed all of his linking books and were imprisoned; Atrus now wishes to see if his sons' imprisonment has reformed them. The player ends up traveling to each brother's prison, in an effort to recover Atrus' daughter Yeesha from the brothers' plot.",
